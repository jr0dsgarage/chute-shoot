# Chute Shoot

*Shoot the Chutes and grab the loot!*

My first [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) project, a shoot-em-up idea based off of a pun.  

There is no shooting.  You are the Shooter.  The Chute Shooter. 

I'm trying mechanic ideas and testing my `C#` skills while learning `Godot 4.0`.

Note the complete lack of chutes at this stage, but check out that sweet, sweet parallax effect.
